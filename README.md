# workshop-epigenomics-RTDs

This is a repository for the NBIS Epigenomics Workshop website.

***!!! OBS!!! Please bear with me and do not make any commits for time being.*** We'll change the html builder to Sphinx, which supports (a much nicer) .rst format. md will still be supported.

Thanks!

Agata
