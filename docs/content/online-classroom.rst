General info
-------------

As of this year, all of the courses administered by NBIS are transitioning to the learning platform Canvas. So is the Epigenomics Data analysis workshop. This year however, is still a bit of a transition year between the previous wwebsite-based editions and the full Canvas experience. This means that much of the content will be linked from the *readthedocs* website onto the `Canvas website <https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/51975>`_. So, on Canvas you will find the schedule for this week with links to the content and exercises on the website. After the course, the material will also be made avialable from Canvas.

Most interactions and talks will be happening on Zoom (Zoom link: TBD). For this, we have created several rooms to accommodate the main session, exercises and group discussions:

**Zoom rooms**

  - Main
  - Quiet room
  - Team 1: DNAwesome
  - Team 2: HISStones
  - Team 3: ATACers
  - Team 4: TufFactors
  - Team 5: MethylNation
  - Q&A 1
  - Q&A 2
  - Q&A 3
  - Extra 1
  - Extra 2
  - Extra 3
  - Extra 4
  - Extra 5

This year we also have a Slack workspace. You should have already gotten an invitation via email to access this (let us know if not!). To keep things a bit in order, we have a general channel and day-specific channels. The general channel can be used for - surprise - more general questions or discussions (setting up the computer, tips and tricks, favorite recipes, ...); while any issues or questions related to specific days can be taken in the appropriate channel. Please try to answer questions in a "thread" to avoid cluttering up the channel!

Where should you be and when?
-----------------------------

**Main session**

* Listen and talk in Main room.
* Please have your cameras on during online sessions in the Main room.
* But mute the mic though; if you would like to ask a question (higly recommended!) raise a virtual hand or write it in in the Zoom chat!

**Exercises**

* choose and do whatever works best for you (anything goes basically)

  - Main room on Zoom to stay connected
  - Quiet room on Zoom to stay connected but work in peace
  - Team room: stay with your team
  - join another team if your team members choose a quiet room or prefer to disconnect
  - you've found a classmate and want to discuss more directly: use Extra (1-5) rooms
  - offline; it is OK to disconnect during exercises

**stuck with exercises? Choose:**

* Main room to ask questions to your teaching team or fellow students (be brave, we all benefit from hearing your question)
* Write in Slack in the appropriate channel or directly to Agata, Jakub or Vincent
