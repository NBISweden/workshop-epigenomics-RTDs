General info
-------------

The main course webpage is this *readthedocs* site, where you can find all the course material, exercises, and links to other resources.
The quiz is hosted in the course `Canvas website <https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/112730>`_.  You should have received an invitation to join the course on Canvas via email.

The schedule for this week is found in :doc:`schedule`, with links to the content and exercises.

We make sure that all the material on this site is up to date and **always** accessible.

During the course we will create a page on *readthedocs* where you can access the presentations.

Most interactions and talks will be happening on Zoom (`Zoom link <https://stockholmuniversity.zoom.us/j/63365179340?pwd=aVD7kAgAPHtZDKWtBItiJXvWL9mjC3.1>`_). For this, we have created several rooms to accommodate the main session, exercises and group discussions:



**Zoom rooms**

  - Main
  - Quiet room
  - Team 1: DNAwesome
  - Team 2: HISStones
  - Team 3: ATACers
  - Team 4: TufFactors
  - Team 5: MethylNation
  - Q&A 1
  - Q&A 2
  - Q&A 3
  - Extra 1
  - Extra 2
  - Extra 3
  - Extra 4
  - Extra 5

We also have a `Slack workspace <https://join.slack.com/t/epigenomicsda-iyv4127/shared_invite/zt-3do2m0iwm-b6ySmNwleHunsqBp2WXkVQ>`_. You should have already gotten an invitation via email to access this (let us know if not!). To keep things somewhat ordered, we have a general channel and day-specific channels. The general channel can be used for more general questions or discussions; while any issues or questions related to specific days can be taken in the appropriate channel. Please try to answer questions in a "thread" to avoid cluttering up the channel! You will have access to this Slack channel after the course, but please bear in mind that the messages have a lifespan of 30 days, after which time they are deleted by Slack.

Where should you be and when?
-----------------------------

**Main session**

* Listen and talk in Main room.
* Please have your cameras on during online sessions in the Main room.
* But mute the mic though; if you would like to ask a question (highly recommended!) raise a virtual hand or write it in in the Zoom chat!

**Exercises**

* You will be moved or move yourself to a smaller breakout room.
* Once there, choose and do whatever works best for you

  - Stay with your team in the team room (preferred option)
  - Move to the Quiet room on Zoom to stay connected but work in peace
  - join another team if your team members choose a quiet room or prefer to disconnect
  - you've found a classmate and want to discuss more directly: use Extra (1-5) rooms
  - offline; it is OK to disconnect during exercises

**stuck with exercises? Choose:**

* Main room to ask questions to your teaching team or fellow students (be brave, we all benefit from hearing your question)
* Write in Slack in the appropriate channel or directly to Agata, Louella or Dania.
