============
ATAC-seq
============

ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing) is a method for determining chromatin accessibility across the genome. It utilizes a hyperactive Tn5 transposase to insert sequencing adapters into open chromatin regions. High-throughput sequencing then yields reads that indicate these regions of increased accessibility.

The sample processing workflow is similar to that of ChIP-seq. There are some small changes, however, and we'll discuss them here.

First of all, the sample should be sequenced using the paired end (PE) protocol. Single end sequencing for ATAC-seq is strongly discouraged, for reasons mentioned below.

Data
======

In this tutorial we will use data from the study of Buenrostro et al. 2013, the first paper on the ATAC-seq method. The data is from a human cell line of purified CD4+ T cells. The original dataset had 2 x 200 million reads and would be too big to process in a training session, so the original dataset was downsampled to 200,000 randomly selected reads. Additionally, about 200,000 reads pairs that will map to chromosome 22 were included to have a good profile on this chromosome, similar to what you might get with a typical ATAC-seq sample.



Prior to aligning reads to the reference genome, the reads must be properly trimmed off adapters - because we will allow "dovetailing" (with the mates seemingly extending "past" each other) of read pairs during alignment:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	<--------------------Mate 1-----------------------
	AGCTTCAACATCGAATACGCCGCAGGCCCCTTCGCCCTATTCTTCATAGC
	  CTTCAACATCGAATACGCCGCAGGCCCCTTCGCCCTATTCTTCATAGCCT
	  ----------------------Mate 2--------------------->


Read alignment can be performed using any aligner which performs global i.e. end-to-end alignment, such as ``bwa-mem``, ``bowtie``, ``bowtie2`` (newer versions). In this tutorial we used ``bowtie2`` for read mapping, for details see the header of bam file. We start from the bam file which contains subset reads aligned to ``hg38`` assembly.


Alignment Processing and QC
============================

First, you need to link the bam file in your working directory. This file has been filtered off alignments with low quality score and contains only properly paired read pairs. You can refer to `bowtie2 manual <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#paired-sam-output>`_ for details. The file is also sorted and inexed.


.. code-block:: bash
	
	mkdir -p atacseq/bam
	cd atacseq/bam

	ln -s /sw/courses/epigenomics/ATACseq_bulk/results/bam/SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.bam .
	ln -s /sw/courses/epigenomics/ATACseq_bulk/results/bam/SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.bam.bai .


First, we would like to know how many fragments mapped to ``chrM``, as reads derived from mitochondrial DNA represent noise in ATAC-seq datasets and can substantially inflate the background level in peak identification.

The output is TAB-delimited with each line consisting of reference sequence name, sequence length, # mapped read-segments and # unmapped read-segments.

.. code-block:: bash

	samtools idxstats SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.bam >SRR891268.idxstats.txt

	#total fragments
	awk '{sum += $3} END {print sum}' SRR891268.idxstats.txt

	#chrM fragments
	awk '$1 ~ /chrM/ {print $3}' SRR891268.idxstats.txt

	> 165586/437490
	[1] 0.3784909

You can see that almost 40% of the fragments mapped to mitochondrial DNA. This is often the case in ATAC-seq experiments (depending on the protocol) and should be taken into account when planning the experiment. We remove these reads in the next step.

The alignment processing steps are similar to :doc:`ChIP-seq data processing <../chipseqProc/lab-chipseq-processing>`. In this example we do not filter out reads mapping to blaclisted regions (found in Encode accession ``ENCFF356LFX``), this step may be necessary, depending on the dataset. 


.. code-block:: bash

	samtools view -h SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.bam | awk '($3 != "chrM")' | samtools view -Shbo SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.bam -

	samtools index SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.bam

	samtools stats SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.bam >SRR891268.stats.txt


The last command collects statistics from BAM files and outputs in a text format. To see the summary:

.. code-block:: bash

	`grep ^SN SRR891268.stats.txt | cut -f 2-`

	# the interesting part
	insert size average:    231.6
	insert size standard deviation: 188.8

You will remove duplicated reads (which likely are PCR duplicates) and collect detailed insert size metrics.

.. code-block:: bash

	module load picard/2.23.4

	java -Xmx64G -jar $PICARD_HOME/picard.jar MarkDuplicates -I SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.bam \
	-O SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.rmdup.bam -M dedup_metrics.txt \
	-VALIDATION_STRINGENCY LENIENT -REMOVE_DUPLICATES true -ASSUME_SORTED true

	java -Xmx64G -jar $PICARD_HOME/picard.jar CollectInsertSizeMetrics \
	-I SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.rmdup.bam -O SRR891268_insert_size_metrics.txt \
	-H SRR891268_insert_size_histogram.pdf -M 0.5

View the resulting histogram of insert sizes ``SRR891268_insert_size_histogram.pdf``. Generating this important QC plot is only possible for PE libraries. Could you guess what the peaks at approximately 50bp, 200bp, 400bp and 600bp correspond to?

To give some context compare to plots on Figure 2.

Peak Calling
=================

We have now finished the data preprocessing. Next, to find regions corresponding to potential open chromatin regions, we want to identify regions where reads have piled up (peaks) greater than the background read coverage.

The tools which are currently used are `Genrich <https://github.com/jsh58/Genrich>`_ and `MACS2 <https://github.com/taoliu/MACS>`_. Genrich has a mode dedicated to ATAC-Seq but is still not published, so both are presented here. The differences between these two are discussed `here <https://informatics.fas.harvard.edu/atac-seq-guidelines.html#peak>`_.

It is very important at this point that we center the reads on the 5â€™ extremity (read start site) as this is where Tn5 cuts. You want your peaks around the nucleosomes and not directly on the nucleosome. However, if we only assess the coverage of the start sites of the reads, the data would be too sparse and it would be impossible to call peaks. Thus, we will extend the start sites of the reads by 100bp (50 bp in each direction) to assess coverage.

When Tn5 cuts an accessible chromatin locus it inserts adapters separated by 9bp, see Figure 4. This means that to have the read start site reflect the centre of where Tn5 bound, the reads on the **positive strand** should be **shifted 4 bp to the right** and reads on the **negative strand** should be **shifted 5 bp to the left** as in Buenrostro et al. 2013.

Genrich
---------

Genrich can apply the read shifts when ATAC-seq mode ``-j`` is selected. 

.. code-block:: bash

	mkdir ../genrich
	cd ../genrich

	# we link the input bam file
	ln -s /sw/courses/epigenomics/ATACseq_bulk/results/bam/SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.rmdup.bam

	# in case not already loaded
	module load bioinfo-tools
	module load samtools/1.8

	# sort the bam file by read name
	samtools sort -n -o SRR891268_hg38.nsort.bam -T sort.tmp SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.rmdup.bam


	/sw/courses/epigenomics/ATACseq_bulk/software/Genrich/Genrich -j -t SRR891268_hg38.nsort.bam  -o SRR891268_genrich.narrowPeak


The output file produced by Genrich is in `ENCODE narrowPeak format <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12>`_, listing the genomic coordinates of each peak called and various statistics.

.. code-block:: bash
	
	chr start end name score strand signalValue pValue qValue peak

	signalValue - Measurement of overall (usually, average) enrichment for the region.
	pValue - Measurement of statistical significance (-log10). Use -1 if no pValue is assigned.
	qValue - Measurement of statistical significance using false discovery rate (-log10). Use -1 if no qValue is assigned.

How many peaks were detected?

.. code-block:: bash
	
	wc -l SRR891268_genrich.narrowPeak
	130617 SRR891268_genrich.narrowPeak

Unfortunately, Genrich does not work very well with our small training dataset (every covered region is called a peak). This is because most of the data is on chr22 whereas the background model was built on the whole genome (Genrich consideres length of all reference seqences included in bam header).

Let's try again with properly prepared bam file, i.e such that the header contains only the chromosome of interest (chr22).

.. code-block:: bash

	
	# we need indexed bam
	samtools index SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.rmdup.bam

	# change bam header to contain only chr22
	nano header
	chr22	50818468
	(ctrl-x to close the file, y to save it)

	#subset bam and change header
	samtools view -h SRR891268_hg38.bowtie2.q30.sorted.noM.rmdup.bam chr22 | \
   		grep -P "@HD|@PG|chr22" | samtools view -Shbo SRR891268_hg38.chr22_rh.bam


	# sort by read name
	samtools sort -n -o SRR891268_hg38.nsort.chr22_rh.bam -T sort.tmp SRR891268_hg38.chr22_rh.bam
	
	# call peaks
	/sw/courses/epigenomics/ATACseq_bulk/software/Genrich/Genrich -j -t SRR891268_hg38.nsort.chr22_rh.bam  -o SRR891268_chr22_genrich.narrowPeak

	#how many peaks
	wc -l SRR891268_chr22_genrich.narrowPeak
	1017 SRR891268_chr22_genrich.narrowPeak

MACS
-----

We need to convert BAM file to BEDPE to correctly apply read shifts to center fragments on the insertion sites.

.. code-block:: bash

	mkdir ../macs
	cd ../macs

	module load BEDTools/2.25.0
	bedtools bamtobed -bedpe -i ../../results/genrich/SRR891268_hg38.nsort.bam >SRR891268.pe.bed

	module load MACS/2.2.6
	macs2 callpeak -t SRR891268.bed -n SRR891268_macs_bedpe -f BEDPE -g 2.7e9 --nomodel --extsize 100 --shift -50 --call-summits --keep-dup all



Please note that we selected ``--extsize 100``  to match the behaviour of Genrich. Normally ``--extsize 200`` would be selected. ``--shift`` needs to be minus half of the size of ``--extsize`` to be centered on the 5â€™, so normally -100. ``--shift -100 --extsize 200`` will amplify the cutting sites' enrichment from ATAC-seq data. So in the end, the peak is where Tn5 transposase likes to attack.


How many peaks were detected?

.. code-block:: bash
	
	wc -l SRR891268_macs_bedpe_peaks.narrowPeak
	2975 SRR891268_macs_bedpe_peaks.narrowPeak


Comparing results of MACS and Genrich
----------------------------------------

How many peaks actually overlap?

.. code-block:: bash
	
	cd ..
	module load BEDTools/2.25.0

	bedtools intersect -a macs/SRR891268_macs_bedpe_peaks.narrowPeak  -b genrich/SRR891268_chr22_genrich.narrowPeak  -f 0.50 -r >peaks_common.bed

	wc -l peaks_common.bed 
	#361 peaks_common.bed

Inspetion of the peak tracks in IGV reveals small differences in peaks called by MACS and Genrich. The very shallow signal in this example does not produce peaks of good quality. Usually MACS tends to detect many shorter peaks whereas Genrich tends to merge these shorter peaks into longer intervals. 

Below is zoom on ``chr22:49,917,416-49,919,778`` one of the locations where both MACS and Genrich found a peak.
