# Epigenomics Data Analysis: from Bulk to Single Cell (NBIS workshop)


This workshop is held online on 23rd - 27th November 2020. Please see [About](about.md) for details.

**To apply**

Go to SciLifeLab homepage for details and [application](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/epigenomics-data-analysis-from-bulk-to-single-cell-2020/). The deadline is the 1st November 2020.


## Workshop Content


This workshop is designed to introduce the best practice bioinformatics methods for processing, analyses and integration of epigenomics and functional genomics data.

Topis covered include:

* **ChIP-seq** and **ATAC-seq**: peak calling, peak independent / dependent quality metrics, differential binding and differential accessibility analysis; DNA motif enrichment;

* Data processing and analyses for differential **DNA methylation** with Illumina EPIC arrays and Bisulfite-seq;

* Functional analysis, including finding nearest genes and custom features, GO terms and Reactome pathways enrichment;

* Integrative visualisations of epigenomics datasets;

* RNA-seq integration for identification of targets of transcription factors;

* Basic multi-omics exploration and integration;

* Introduction to analysis of single cell functional genomics data (ATAC-seq);
