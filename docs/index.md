This workshop is designed to introduce the best practice bioinformatics methods for processing, analyses and integration of epigenomics and functional genomics data.

Topis covered include:

* **ChIP-seq** and **ATAC-seq**: peak calling, peak independent / dependent quality metrics, differential binding and differential accessibility analysis; DNA motif enrichment;

* Data processing and analyses for differential **DNA methylation** with Illumina EPIC arrays and Bisulfite-seq;
* **Functional analysis**, including finding nearest genes and custom features, GO terms and Reactome pathways enrichment;
* **Integrative visualisations** of epigenomics datasets;
* RNA-seq integration for identification of targets of transcription factors;
* Basic multi-omics exploration and integration;
* Introduction to analysis of single cell functional genomics data (ATAC-seq);
* **Nf-cores pipelines**: metylseq, chipseq, atacseq
