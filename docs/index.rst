==========================================================
Welcome to Epigenomics Workshop Test Page!
==========================================================



Online workshop open for PhD students, postdocs, researchers and other employees within Swedish academia. This course is organised by the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS).

This workshop builds on our previous `ChIPseq data analysis workshop <https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-archive/workshop-ChIP-seq/2018-11-07>`_ to introduce best practice bioinformatics methods for processing, analyses and integration of epigenomics data. The online teaching includes lectures, programming tutorials and interactive group sessions.

Workshop content
----------------

This workshop is designed to introduce best practice bioinformatics methods for processing, analyses and integration of epigenomics and functional genomics data.

Topis covered include:

- Data processing and analyses for differential **DNA methylation** with Illumina EPIC arrays and Bisulfite-seq;
- **ChIP-seq** and **ATAC-seq**: peak calling, peak independent / dependent quality metrics, differential binding and differential accessibility analysis; DNA motif enrichment;
- **Functional analysis**, including finding nearest genes and custom features, GO terms and Reactome pathways enrichment;
- **Integrative visualisations** of epigenomics datasets;
- RNA-seq integration for identification of targets of transcription factors;
- Basic multi-omics exploration and integration;
- Introduction to analysis of single cell functional genomics data (ATAC-seq);
- **Nf-cores pipelines**: Methylseq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq

Selection criteria
------------------

 - Due to limited capacity the workshop can accommodate maximum of 30 participants. If we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on several criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the course as well as gender and geographical balance.
 - NBIS prioritises academic participants, especially PhD students, affiliated with Swedish universities. We warmly welcome international and/or non-academic participants when we have seats available and the requirements criteria are met.

Certificate & University credits
--------------------------------

We will issue a course certificate upon a successful course completion, assessed by active participation in all course sessions (lectures, computer practicals, group discussion etc.).

Unfortunately we are **not** able to warrant any university credits (högskolepoäng). Many universities however, recognize the attendance in our courses and award 1.5 HPs, corresponding to a 40 h of studying. It is up to participants to clarify and arrange credit transfer with the relevant university department.
